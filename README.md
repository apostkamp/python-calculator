# ðŸ§® Python Command-Line Calculator

A simple and interactive command-line calculator built with Python. This program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operationsâ€”`addition`, `subtraction`, `multiplication`, and `division`â€”repeatedly until they choose to exit.

### ðŸ§  How It Works:

â€¢ The program enters a while loop, continuously prompting the user to perform a calculation.

â€¢ Upon choosing to perform a calculation (Y), the user is asked to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation.

â€¢ The program then computes and displays the result.

â€¢ After each calculation, the user is asked if they wish to perform another calculation.

â€¢ If the user chooses N, the program exits.

### ðŸš€ How to Run:

â€¢ Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/username/calculator.git`

`cd calculator`

â€¢ Run the program:

`python calculator.py`

â€¢ Follow the on-screen prompts
